Hamburger Menu Example:

The way this is done is by tweaking the Master-Detail Page a bit. The Master Page is always hidden and is only shown when the
hamburger button is clicked. The Master Page contains all the icons and text in the hamburger menu. The Detail page of the Master-Detail
Page is the page the User wants to load. Clicking the appropriate item in he Master Page's ListView will change the Detail page
accordingly.
